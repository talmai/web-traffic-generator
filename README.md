# web-traffic-generator

A docker container of a quick and dirty HTTP/S "organic" traffic generator.

### Available on Docker Hub

`docker pull talmai/web-traffic-generator`

## About

Just a simple (poorly written) Python script that aimlessly "browses" the internet by starting at pre-defined `ROOT_URLS` and randomly "clicking" links on pages until the pre-defined `MAX_DEPTH` is met. Forked from [ReconInfoSec/web-traffic-generator](https://github.com/ReconInfoSec/web-traffic-generator). Pre-built with enough URLs in the config file to allow for simple deployment.

## How it works

About as simple as it gets...

**First, specify a few settings at the top of the script...**

- `MAX_DEPTH = 10`, `MIN_DEPTH = 5` Starting from each root URL (ie: www.yahoo.com), our generator will click to a depth
radomly selected between MIN_DEPTH and MAX_DEPTH.

*The interval between every HTTP GET requests is chosen at random between the following two variables...*

- `MIN_WAIT = 5` Wait a minimum of `5` seconds between requests... Be careful with making requests to quickly as that tends to piss off web servers.
- `MAX_WAIT = 10` I think you get the point.

- `DEBUG = False` A poor man's logger. Set to `True` for verbose realtime printing to console for debugging or development. I'll incorporate proper logging later on (maybe).

- `ROOT_URLS = [url1,url2,url3]` The list of root URLs to start from when browsing. Randomly selected.

- `blacklist = [".gif", "intent/tweet", "badlink", etc...]` A blacklist of strings that we check every link against. If the link contains any of the strings in this list, it's discarded. Useful to avoid things that are not traffic-generator friendly like "Tweet this!" links or links to image files.

- `userAgent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_3).......'` You guessed it, the user-agent our headless browser hands over to the web server. You can probably leave it set to the default, but feel free to change it. I would strongly suggest using a common/valid one or else you'll likely get rate-limited quick.

## Dependencies

Only thing you need and *might* not have is `requests`. Grab it with

```bash
sudo pip install requests
```

## Usage

Create your config file first:

```bash
cp config.py.template config.py
```

Run the generator:

```bash
python gen.py
```

## Troubleshooting and debugging

To get more deets on what is happening under the hood, change the Debug variable in `config.py` from `False` to `True`. This provides the following output...

```console

```

The last URL attempted provides a good example of when a particular URL throws an error. We simply add it to our `config.blacklist` array in memory, and continue browsing. This prevents a known bad URL from returning to the queue.
